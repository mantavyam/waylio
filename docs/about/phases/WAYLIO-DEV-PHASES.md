# Waylio Development Phases - Complete Roadmap

Based on the comprehensive architecture blueprint, here's a detailed phased development approach that ensures atomicity, proper sequencing, and seamless connectivity:

## ðŸ“Š **Development Phases Timeline**

| Phase | Name                           | Dependencies | Priority |
| ----- | ------------------------------ | ------------ | -------- |
| 0     | Foundation & Infrastructure    | None         | CRITICAL |
| 1     | Admin Portal & User Management | Phase 0      | CRITICAL |
| 2     | Doctor/Staff Onboarding        | Phase 1      | CRITICAL |
| 3     | Mobile App Foundation          | Phase 0, 1   | CRITICAL |
| 4     | P1: Appointments & Queue       | Phase 2, 3   | CRITICAL |
| 5     | P2: Digital Prescriptions      | Phase 4      | CRITICAL |
| 6     | P3: AR Navigation              | Phase 3      | CRITICAL |
| 7     | P4: Smart Parking              | Phase 6      | CRITICAL |
| 8     | Notifications Enhancement      | Phase 4-7    | HIGH     |
| 9     | Admin Analytics & Reports      | Phase 4-7    | MEDIUM   |
| 10    | Feedback Management            | Phase 4-7    | MEDIUM   |

**Parallel Development Opportunities:**

- Phases 4, 5, 6, 7 can have some parallel work after Phase 3 completes
- Phase 8, 9, 10 can be developed in parallel
- Design work can happen ahead of development phases

**File Location for Phases**
- Phase 1 to 3: /Users/mantavyam/Projects/waylio/docs/about/phases/PHASE-1-TO-3.md
- Phase 4 to 6: /Users/mantavyam/Projects/waylio/docs/about/phases/PHASE-4-TO-6.md
- Phase 7 to 10: /Users/mantavyam/Projects/waylio/docs/about/phases/PHASE-7-TO-10.md

## ðŸŽ¯ **PHASE 0: Foundation & Infrastructure Setup**

**Blocking: All subsequent phases**

### **Why This First?**

Every other feature depends on having a working infrastructure, authentication, and data models in place.

### **Deliverables:**

#### **0.1 Monorepo Setup**

- Initialize Turborepo with PNPM workspaces
- Create directory structure: `apps/`, `packages/`
- Setup `shared-types`, `database`, `config` packages
- Configure TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier across workspace

#### **0.2 Database Foundation**

- Design complete Prisma schema with all tables:
    - `users`, `doctors`, `staff`, `patients`
    - `appointments`, `queue_status`
    - `prescriptions`, `prescription_items`
    - `parking_sessions`, `payments`
    - `feedback`, `medical_records`, `points_of_interest`
- Setup PostgreSQL on Render
- Create initial migrations
- Seed basic data (departments, specializations)

#### **0.3 Backend API Skeleton**

- Setup Node.js + Express/Fastify in `apps/api`
- Implement middleware stack:
    - JWT authentication middleware
    - RBAC middleware
    - Rate limiting
    - Request validation (Zod)
    - Error handler with standard APIError format
- Configure environment variables
- Setup Redis connection for caching
- Deploy basic "health check" API to Render

#### **0.4 Shared Type System**

- Define all TypeScript interfaces in `packages/shared-types`:
    - API request/response types
    - Database model types (from Prisma)
    - User roles enum
    - Error codes enum
    - WebSocket event types

#### **0.5 Testing Infrastructure**

- Setup Jest for backend unit tests
- Configure integration test environment
- Setup test database

**âœ… Exit Criteria:**

- Monorepo builds successfully
- Database connected and migrated
- API health endpoint returns 200
- Type-safe imports work across packages
- Basic CI/CD pipeline configured

# Dashboard Navigation & Authentication Fixes

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Removed Role Field from Login Form
- Updated `apps/website/components/login-form.tsx`
- Removed role selection dropdown from login
- Role is now automatically determined from user credentials in the backend
- Simplified authentication flow

### 2. ✅ Implemented Sign Out Functionality
- Updated `packages/ui/src/components/nav-user.tsx` to accept `onSignOut` callback
- Added click handler to "Log out" menu item
- Sign out now properly calls NextAuth's `signOut()` function
- Redirects to home page after sign out

### 3. ✅ Made Sidebar Navigation Functional
- Updated `packages/ui/src/components/nav-main.tsx`:
  - Added active state tracking
  - Added `isActive` prop to highlight selected menu item
  - Added `onNavigate` callback for navigation handling
  
- Updated `packages/ui/src/components/app-sidebar.tsx`:
  - Accepts `user`, `onSignOut`, and `onNavigate` props
  - Passes callbacks to child components
  
- Created `apps/web/components/dashboard/dashboard-client.tsx`:
  - Client component to handle state and navigation
  - Implements view switching based on sidebar selection
  - Shows placeholder content for:
    - Dashboard (default - shows charts and data)
    - Lifecycle
    - Analytics
    - Projects
    - Team
  - Active button has visual indication via `isActive` state

### 4. ✅ Updated Dashboard Architecture
- `apps/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx` now uses server component for auth
- Passes user data to `DashboardClient` component
- Client component handles all interactive features

## Registration Issue

The signup form is working correctly. The "Failed to fetch" error you're seeing is likely due to one of these issues:

### Possible Causes:
1. **Backend not running** - Ensure backend is running on port 4000
2. **CORS configuration** - Backend needs to allow requests from localhost:3001
3. **Network connectivity** - Check browser console for detailed error

### To Debug:
```bash
# 1. Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:4000/api/v1/auth/login -X POST

# 2. Check backend logs for errors

# 3. Open browser DevTools Network tab and try signup again
```

### Backend Expected Payload:
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "password": "password123",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "role": "PATIENT"
}
```

The signup form (`apps/website/components/signup-form.tsx`) sends data in the correct format with camelCase field names.

## How to Test

### 1. Start All Services
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd apps/backend
pnpm dev

# Terminal 2 - Web App
cd apps/web
pnpm dev

# Terminal 3 - Website
cd apps/website
pnpm dev
```

### 2. Test Login
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/auth/login
2. Enter credentials (no role selection needed)
3. Should redirect to http://localhost:3000/dashboard

### 3. Test Navigation
1. In dashboard, click different sidebar items
2. Active item should be highlighted
3. Content area should change

### 4. Test Sign Out
1. Click user avatar in sidebar footer
2. Click "Log out"
3. Should redirect to home page
4. Session should be cleared

## Access Denied for Non-Admin Users

As you correctly noted, other role-based dashboards (Doctor, Patient, Reception) are not yet implemented. This is expected behavior. The current implementation focuses on the Admin dashboard.

### Future Implementation Needed:
- Doctor dashboard pages
- Patient dashboard pages  
- Reception dashboard pages
- Role-based routing and access control
- Role-specific features and views

## Technical Details

### Component Hierarchy
```
DashboardPage (Server Component)
  └─ DashboardClient (Client Component)
      ├─ AppSidebar
      │   ├─ NavMain (handles navigation)
      │   ├─ NavDocuments
      │   ├─ NavSecondary
      │   └─ NavUser (handles sign out)
      └─ SidebarInset
          ├─ SiteHeader
          └─ Content Area (changes based on activeView)
```

### State Management
- Navigation state: Managed in `DashboardClient` via `activeView`
- Active menu item: Managed in `NavMain` via `activeItem`
- User session: Managed by NextAuth

### Props Flow
```
DashboardPage
  → user data
    → DashboardClient
      → onSignOut, onNavigate, user
        → AppSidebar
          → onNavigate
            → NavMain (handles menu clicks)
          → onSignOut
            → NavUser (handles logout)
```
